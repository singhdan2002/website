                Brutalist architecture is known for its raw, unpolished appearance and the use of concrete as a primary building material. This style emerged in the 1950s and was popularized in the 1960s and 1970s. The term "brutalism" is derived from the French phrase "beton brut," which translates to "raw concrete." The following are some of the defining characteristics of brutalist architecture: <br>

                Use of raw materials: Brutalist architecture is characterized by the use of raw, unpolished materials such as concrete, brick, and steel. The use of these materials gives the buildings a rough, unfinished look. </p>
                
                <p class="col">
                Massiveness and Monumentality: Brutalist buildings are often large in scale and appear monolithic in nature. They have a sense of massiveness and monumentality that can be imposing. <br>
                
                Bold Geometric Forms: Brutalist buildings often feature bold, geometric shapes and forms, such as sharp angles and curves. These forms are often expressed through the use of concrete and steel. </p>

                <p class="col">
                Structural Expressionism: Brutalist architecture is known for its emphasis on the structural elements of a building. Exposed concrete columns, beams, and other structural features are often left visible and celebrated as part of the design. <br>
                
                Utilitarianism: Brutalist architecture prioritizes function over aesthetics. Buildings are designed to serve a specific purpose, and the design is often dictated by this function. </p>
                
                <p class="col">
                Emphasis on Brutality: Brutalist architecture embraces an aesthetic of rawness and harshness. Buildings often have a rough, brutal appearance that can be seen as a response to the sleek, polished buildings that were popular in the mid-20th century. <br>
                
                Overall, brutalist architecture is characterized by its raw, unpolished appearance, use of raw materials, large scale and monumentality, bold geometric forms, structural expressionism, utilitarianism, and emphasis on brutality. These characteristics have made brutalism a distinct and recognizable architectural style that has inspired both admiration and controversy. <br>
