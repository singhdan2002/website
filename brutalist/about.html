                Welcome to my website dedicated to exploring brutalist architecture. I am excited to share with you the unique and inspiring features of this architectural style. <br> <br>

                To help me with the design and content of this website, I enlisted the help of ChatGPT, a powerful language model developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT provided me with valuable inspiration for the typography, color scheme, and initial style of the website, drawing from the iconic DALL-E project by OpenAI. <br> <br>

                Using ChatGPT, I was able to generate a comprehensive sitemap and content suggestions for the website. All the text content on each page of the website, as well as the images to complement the text, were suggested by ChatGPT. The mid-journey prompts that guide visitors through the website and direct them to the appropriate images for each page were also created by ChatGPT. <br> <br>

                It's amazing to see how much ChatGPT has contributed to the development of this website. Even this text that you are reading now was generated by ChatGPT. <br> <br>

                Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy learning more about brutalist architecture! <br> <br>
